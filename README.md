# Splatoon-Map-Rotations
A website to display the current splatoon maps

Welcome to Splatooniverse. This is a fansite for the game Splatoon for Wii U. 
Splatoon is a multiplayer game where you shoot ink to cover territory, and complete objectives similar to paintball.
There are 4 stages at a time for players to play on (2 turf war stages, 2 ranked stages). These stages rotate every 4 hours.
This project is a website that shows the stages running at the moment, and the ones for the next 8 hours.
